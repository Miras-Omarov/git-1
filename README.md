----CRUD----
LENGTH LIMIT:
ID - 8 symbols
NAME - 30 symbols
QUANTITY - 8 symbols
PRICE - no limit.
You don't have to input product id - the program will automatically find the highest id in the file. 
Also, the code adds spaces until the length of ID,NAME,QUANTITY does not equal to its limit,so it looks prettier.
create pattern:
id      productName                   quantityprice
