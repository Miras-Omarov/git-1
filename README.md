----CRUD----
LENGTH LIMIT:
ID - 8 symbols
NAME - 30 symbols
QUANTITY - 8 symbols
PRICE - no limit.
You don't have to input product id while creating - the program will automatically find the highest id in the file. 
Also, the code adds spaces until the length of ID,NAME,QUANTITY does not equal to its limit,so it looks prettier.
